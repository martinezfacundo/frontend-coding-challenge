I used React because that's where I feel most comfortable. I first started reading the API information and learned how to use the query to find a specific date, then I made an asynchronous function to get the repositories, and also a function to change the pages to show all the repositories. The user can navigate through the pages manually and see all the different repositories. Every time a user changes the page, the async function performs a search.
